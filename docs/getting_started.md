# Getting started

This project has a single dependency; Nix. It will be used to pull in all
other dependencies. It can be installed by following the instructions
over there: https://nixos.org/download.html#nix-quick-install

Now that's done, got to your project root and create an empty `devshell.toml`.

There are different ways to load that config depending on your preferences:

Add another file called `shell.nix` with the following content. This file will
contain some nix code. Don't worry about the details.

```nix
{ system ? builtins.currentSystem }:
let
  src = fetchTarball "https://github.com/numtide/devshell/archive/master.tar.gz";
  devshell = import src { inherit system; };
in
devshell.fromTOML ./devshell.toml
```

Now you can enter the developer shell for the project:

```console
$ nix-shell
warning: you did not specify '--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
these 4 derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/nvbfq9h68r63k5jkfnbimny3b35sx0fs-devshell-bashrc.drv
  /nix/store/ppfyf9zv023an8477hcbjlj0rbyvmwq7-devshell.env.drv

[devshell]$
```

## Adding new commands

In order to bring in new dependencies, you can either add them to
`devshell.packages` or to the `commands` list. Commands are also added to the
menu so they might be preferable for discovery.

As an exercise, add the following snippet to your `devshell.toml`:

```toml
[[commands]]
package = "go"
```

Then re-enter the shell with `nix-shell`. You should see something like this:

```console
$ nix-shell
warning: you did not specify '--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector

  /nix/store/nvbfq9h68r63k5jkfnbimny3b35sx0fs-devshell-bashrc.drv

[general commands]

  menu - prints this menu
  go   - The Go Programming language

[devshell]$
```

Now the `go` program is available in the environment and can be used to
develop Go programs. This can easily be adapted to any language.

Similarly, you could also add go to the packages list, in which case it would
not appear in the menu:

```toml
[devshell]
packages = [
  "go"
]
```

devshell is extensible in many different ways. The next chapter will show all
of the configuration options available.
